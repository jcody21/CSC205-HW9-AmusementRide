<h3>Specification</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Copy the program <a href="http://azfoo.net/gdt/csc205/assignments/02019/AmusementRide.java.txt">AmusementRide.java</a>
to your computer and add your own class that 
extends <i>class AmusementRide</i>.
</p>
<p>
Note: <a href="http://azfoo.net/gdt/csc205/assignments/02019/AmusementRide.java.txt">AmusementRide.java</a> contains 
two classes (<i>class FerrisWheel</i> and <i>class RollerCoaster</i>)
that provide examples for the class you must create.
</p>
<p>
Your class must include the following.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Implementations for all of the abstract methods defined
in <i>abstract class AmusementRide</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At least one static class variable and at least one instance
variable that are not defined in <i>abstract class AmusementRide</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Override the inherited <i>repair()</i> method following the
instructions given in the <i>repair()</i> method comment block.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Override the inherited <i>toString()</i> that returns a <i>String</i>
representation of your ride objects. The <i>String</i> must contain 
the <i>String</i> returned from the inherited <i>toString()</i> method.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>main()</i> method in <i>abstract class AmusementRide</i>
must keep the <i>class FerrisWheel</i> and <i>class RollerCoaster</i>
objects. The <i>main()</i> method must also keep the following behavior:
</p>
<pre>   // pseudo-code...
   obj.load() 
   if (obj.start())
      obj.stop()
   obj.repair()
</pre>
<p>
However, you must change the <i>main()</i> method to
use polymorphism.  <small>[hint: array]</small>
</p>
<p>
The first six lines of the program's output must match the following.
</p>
<pre>Ferris wheel "The Billy Preston" has capacity of 50 and costs $6.28
...height: 100; # of spins: 0
mechanics are on strike
Roller coaster "for(;;) Young" has capacity of 32 and costs $3.14
...maxSpeed: 99; trackLength: 25; whiplashFactor: 1.618
mechanics are on strike
</pre>
<h5>Example Output</h5>
<p>
CSC205 student Edith Foogooman created <i>class BumperCar</i> and she
named her ride "Self-driving Bumpers".  The output of her program looked 
as follows.
</p>
<pre>Ferris wheel "The Billy Preston" has capacity of 50 and costs $6.28
...height: 100; # of spins: 0
mechanics are on strike
Roller coaster "for(;;) Young" has capacity of 32 and costs $3.14
...maxSpeed: 99; trackLength: 25; whiplashFactor: 1.618
mechanics are on strike
Bumper cars "Self-driving Bumpers" has capacity of 17 and costs $6.28
...weight: 13; speed: 8; os: Linux
Self-driving Bumpers has been loaded
Self-driving Bumpers has started
Self-driving Bumpers has stopped
Self-driving Bumpers has been repaired
</pre>
